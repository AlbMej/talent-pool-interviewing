# xAI Talent Pool Interview Tab

A Flask application that implements the Interviewing tab of the [xAI Talent Pool Project](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/xai-talent-pool). This component provides video recording, Grok/LLM-powered interview questions, and interactive skill tree visualization.

## Background
This repo was created as part of the 2025 xAI hackathon to develop the Interviewing tab as an independent component of the [xAI Talent Pool](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/xai-talent-pool) Project, enabling parallel development with the main application. The skill trees used in this interface are generated by the [xAI Skill Tree Generator](https://github.com/AlbMej/xai-skill-tree-generator)

## Features

- **Video Recording**: Access camera and microphone with start/stop controls
- **Audio Waveform**: Animated waveform visualization during recording
- **Skill Tree Visualization**: Beautiful D3.js hierarchical tree visualization with progress tracking
- **Recommended Questions**: Grok/LLM-powered interview questions based on skill tree
- **Question History**: Track asked questions with timestamps
- **Live Transcript**: Display interview transcript in real-time
- **Mute/Unmute**: Control audio input during recording

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies (for TypeScript compilation):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build TypeScript files:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or for development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Development

The frontend is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. To make changes:

1. Edit files in the `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to compile, or `npm run watch` for auto-compilation
3. Refresh your browser

## Usage

1. Allow camera and microphone access when prompted
2. Click "Start" to begin recording
3. Use recommended questions or ask your own
4. Watch skill progress update as the interview progresses
5. View transcript and question history in the left panel
6. Explore the beautiful hierarchical skill tree visualization

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application page
- `GET /api/v1/skill-trees/<job_id>` - Get skill tree by job ID
- `GET /api/v1/skill-trees/default` - Get default skill tree
- `POST /api/v1/generate-interview-questions` - Generate interview questions

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript compiled to JavaScript
- **Visualization**: D3.js for hierarchical tree visualization
- **Media**: WebRTC APIs for camera/microphone access

## Notes

- The application uses browser WebRTC APIs for media access
- Skill progress updates are simulated based on transcript keywords
- The skill tree uses D3.js for a beautiful hierarchical visualization
- In production, integrate with actual AI services for question generation and skill assessment
